/*
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
	hra   = 20% of basic
	da    = 50% of basic
	allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
	allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
	allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
	pf    = 11% of basic.
	
Sample Input 1 :
10000 A
Sample Output 1 :
17600
